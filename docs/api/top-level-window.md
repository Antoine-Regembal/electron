# TopLevelWindow

> Create and control native windows.

Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

## Frameless window

To create a window without chrome, or a transparent window in arbitrary shape,
you can use the [Frameless Window](frameless-window.md) API.

## Parent and child windows

By using `parent` option, you can create child windows:

```javascript
const { TopLevelWindow } = require('electron')

let top = new TopLevelWindow()
let child = new TopLevelWindow({ parent: top })
child.show()
top.show()
```

The `child` window will always show on top of the `top` window.

## Modal windows

A modal window is a child window that disables parent window, to create a modal
window, you have to set both `parent` and `modal` options:

```javascript
let child = new TopLevelWindow({ parent: top, modal: true, show: false })
child.show()
```

## Platform notices

* On macOS modal windows will be displayed as sheets attached to the parent window.
* On macOS the child windows will keep the relative position to parent window
  when parent window moves, while on Windows and Linux child windows will not
  move.
* On Linux the type of modal windows will be changed to `dialog`.
* On Linux many desktop environments do not support hiding a modal window.

## Class: TopLevelWindow

> Create and control native windows.

Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

`TopLevelWindow` is an [EventEmitter][event-emitter].

### `new TopLevelWindow([options])` _Experimental_

* `options` [TopLevelWindowOptions](structures/top-level-window-options.md) (optional)

Creates a new `TopLevelWindow` with native properties as set by the `options`.

When setting minimum or maximum window size with `minWidth`/`maxWidth`/
`minHeight`/`maxHeight`, it only constrains the users. It won't prevent you from
passing a size that does not follow size constraints to `setBounds`/`setSize` or
to the constructor of `BrowserWindow`.

The possible values and behaviors of the `type` option are platform dependent.
Possible values are:

* On Linux, possible types are `desktop`, `dock`, `toolbar`, `splash`,
  `notification`.
* On macOS, possible types are `desktop`, `textured`.
  * The `textured` type adds metal gradient appearance
    (`NSTexturedBackgroundWindowMask`).
  * The `desktop` type places the window at the desktop background window level
    (`kCGDesktopWindowLevel - 1`). Note that desktop window will not receive
    focus, keyboard or mouse events, but you can use `globalShortcut` to receive
    input sparingly.
* On Windows, possible type is `toolbar`.

### Instance Events

Objects created with `new TopLevelWindow` emit the following events:

**Note:** Some events are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

#### Event: 'close'

Returns:

* `event` Event

Emitted when the window is going to be closed. Calling `event.preventDefault()`
will cancel the close.

#### Event: 'closed'

Emitted when the window is closed. After you have received this event you should
remove the reference to the window and avoid using it any more.

#### Event: 'session-end' _Windows_

Emitted when window session is going to end due to force shutdown or machine restart
or session log off.

#### Event: 'blur'

Emitted when the window loses focus.

#### Event: 'focus'

Emitted when the window gains focus.

#### Event: 'show'

Emitted when the window is shown.

#### Event: 'hide'

Emitted when the window is hidden.

#### Event: 'maximize'

Emitted when window is maximized.

#### Event: 'unmaximize'

Emitted when the window exits from a maximized state.

#### Event: 'minimize'

Emitted when the window is minimized.

#### Event: 'restore'

Emitted when the window is restored from a minimized state.

#### Event: 'will-resize' _macOS_ _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `newBounds` [Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md) - Size the window is being resized to.

Emitted before the window is resized. Calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the window from being resized.

Note that this is only emitted when the window is being resized manually. Resizing the window with `setBounds`/`setSize` will not emit this event.

#### Event: 'resize'

Emitted after the window has been resized.

#### Event: 'will-move' _macOS_ _Windows_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `newBounds` [Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md) - Location the window is being moved to.

Emitted before the window is moved. On Windows, calling `event.preventDefault()` will prevent the window from being moved.

Note that this is only emitted when the window is being resized manually. Resizing the window with `setBounds`/`setSize` will not emit this event.

#### Event: 'move'

Emitted when the window is being moved to a new position.

__Note__: On macOS this event is an alias of `moved`.

#### Event: 'moved' _macOS_

Emitted once when the window is moved to a new position.

#### Event: 'enter-full-screen'

Emitted when the window enters a full-screen state.

#### Event: 'leave-full-screen'

Emitted when the window leaves a full-screen state.

#### Event: 'always-on-top-changed'

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `isAlwaysOnTop` Boolean

Emitted when the window is set or unset to show always on top of other windows.

#### Event: 'app-command' _Windows_ _Linux_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `command` String

Emitted when an [App Command](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646275(v=vs.85).aspx)
is invoked. These are typically related to keyboard media keys or browser
commands, as well as the "Back" button built into some mice on Windows.

Commands are lowercased, underscores are replaced with hyphens, and the
`APPCOMMAND_` prefix is stripped off.
e.g. `APPCOMMAND_BROWSER_BACKWARD` is emitted as `browser-backward`.

```javascript
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')
let win = new BrowserWindow()
win.on('app-command', (e, cmd) => {
  // Navigate the window back when the user hits their mouse back button
  if (cmd === 'browser-backward' && win.webContents.canGoBack()) {
    win.webContents.goBack()
  }
})
```

The following app commands are explicitly supported on Linux:

* `browser-backward`
* `browser-forward`

#### Event: 'scroll-touch-begin' _macOS_

Emitted when scroll wheel event phase has begun.

#### Event: 'scroll-touch-end' _macOS_

Emitted when scroll wheel event phase has ended.

#### Event: 'swipe' _macOS_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `direction` String

Emitted on 3-finger swipe. Possible directions are `up`, `right`, `down`, `left`.

#### Event: 'rotate-gesture' _macOS_

Returns:

* `event` Event
* `rotation` Float

Emitted on trackpad rotation gesture. Continually emitted until rotation gesture is
ended. The `rotation` value on each emission is the angle in degrees rotated since
the last emission. The last emitted event upon a rotation gesture will always be of
value `0`. Counter-clockwise rotation values are positive, while clockwise ones are
negative.

#### Event: 'sheet-begin' _macOS_

Emitted when the window opens a sheet.

#### Event: 'sheet-end' _macOS_

Emitted when the window has closed a sheet.

#### Event: 'new-window-for-tab' _macOS_

Emitted when the native new tab button is clicked.

### Static Methods

The `TopLevelWindow` class has the following static methods:

#### `TopLevelWindow.getAllWindows()`

Returns `TopLevelWindow[]` - An array of all opened browser windows.

#### `TopLevelWindow.getFocusedWindow()`

Returns `TopLevelWindow | null` - The window that is focused in this
application, otherwise returns `null`.

#### `TopLevelWindow.fromId(id)`

* `id` Integer

Returns `BrowserWindow` - The window with the given `id`.

### Instance Properties

// In this example `win` is our instance
let win = new TopLevelWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 })
```

#### `win.id` _Readonly_

A `Integer` property representing the unique ID of the window. Each ID is unique among all `BrowserWindow` instances of the entire Electron application.

#### `win.autoHideMenuBar`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window menu bar should hide itself automatically. Once set, the menu bar will only show when users press the single `Alt` key.

If the menu bar is already visible, setting this property to `true` won't
hide it immediately.

#### `win.simpleFullScreen`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window is in simple (pre-Lion) fullscreen mode.

#### `win.visibleOnAllWorkspaces`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window is visible on all workspaces.

**Note:** If the menu bar is auto-hide, users can still bring up the menu bar by pressing the single `Alt` key.

####  `win.kiosk`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window is in kiosk mode.

#### `win.documentEdited` _macOS_

A `Boolean` property that specifies whether the windowâ€™s document has been edited.

The icon in title bar will become gray when set to `true`.

#### `win.representedFilename` _macOS_

A `String` property that determines the pathname of the file the window represents,
and the icon of the file will show in window's title bar.

#### `win.title`

A `String` property that determines the title of the native window.

**Note:** The title of the web page can be different from the title of the native window.

#### `win.minimizable`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window can be manually minimized by user.

On Linux the setter is a no-op, although the getter returns `true`.

#### `win.maximizable`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window can be manually maximized by user.

On Linux the setter is a no-op, although the getter returns `true`.

#### `win.fullScreenable`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the maximize/zoom window button toggles fullscreen mode or
maximizes the window.

#### `win.resizable`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window can be manually resized by user.

#### `win.closable`

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window can be manually closed by user.

On Linux the setter is a no-op, although the getter returns `true`.

#### `win.movable`

A `Boolean` property that determines Whether the window can be moved by user.

On Linux the setter is a no-op, although the getter returns `true`.

#### `win.excludedFromShownWindowsMenu` _macOS_

A `Boolean` property that determines whether the window is excluded from the applicationâ€™s Windows menu. `false` by default.

const menu = Menu.buildFromTemplate(template)
Menu.setApplicationMenu(menu)
```

#### `win.accessibleTitle`

A `String` property that defines an alternative title provided only to
accessibility tools such as screen readers. This string is not directly
visible to users.

### Instance Methods

Objects created with `new BrowserWindow` have the following instance methods:

**Note:** Some methods are only available on specific operating systems and are
labeled as such.

#### `win.destroy()`

Force closing the window, the `unload` and `beforeunload` event won't be emitted
for the web page, and `close` event will also not be emitted
for this window, but it guarantees the `closed` event will be emitted.

#### `win.close()`

Try to close the window. This has the same effect as a user manually clicking
the close button of the window. The web page may cancel the close though. See
the [close event](#event-close).

#### `win.focus()`

Focuses on the window.

#### `win.blur()`

Removes focus from the window.

#### `win.isFocused()`

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the window is focused.

#### `win.isDestroyed()`

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the window is destroyed.

#### `win.isVisible()`

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the window is visible to the user.

#### `win.isModal()`

Returns `Boolean` - Whether current window is a modal window.

#### `win.maximize()`

Maximizes the window. This will also show (but not focus) the window if it
isn't being displayed already.

#### `win.unmaximize()`

Unmaximizes the window.

#### `win.isMaximized()`

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the window is maximized.

#### `win.minimize()`

Minimizes the window. On some platforms the minimized window will be shown in
the Dock.

#### `win.restore()`

Restores the window from minimized state to its previous state.

#### `win.isMinimized()`

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the window is minimized.

#### `win.setFullScreen(flag)`

* `flag` Boolean

Sets whether the window should be in fullscreen mode.

#### `win.isFullScreen()`

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the window is in fullscreen mode.

#### `win.setSimpleFullScreen(flag)` _macOS_

* `flag` Boolean

Enters or leaves simple fullscreen mode.

Simple fullscreen mode emulates the native fullscreen behavior found in versions of macOS prior to Lion (10.7).

#### `win.isSimpleFullScreen()` _macOS_

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the window is in simple (pre-Lion) fullscreen mode.

#### `win.isNormal()`

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the window is in normal state (not maximized, not minimized, not in fullscreen mode).

#### `win.setAspectRatio(aspectRatio[, extraSize])` _macOS_ _Linux_

* `aspectRatio` Float - The aspect ratio to maintain for some portion of the
content view.
 * `extraSize` [Size](structures/size.md) (optional) _macOS_ - The extra size not to be included while
maintaining the aspect ratio.

This will make a window maintain an aspect ratio. The extra size allows a
developer to have space, specified in pixels, not included within the aspect
ratio calculations. This API already takes into account the difference between a
window's size and its content size.

Consider a normal window with an HD video player and associated controls.
Perhaps there are 15 pixels of controls on the left edge, 25 pixels of controls
on the right edge and 50 pixels of controls below the player. In order to
maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio (standard aspect ratio for HD @1920x1080) within
the player itself we would call this function with arguments of 16/9 and
{ width: 40, height: 50 }. The second argument doesn't care where the extra width and height
are within the content view--only that they exist. Sum any extra width and
height areas you have within the overall content view.

#### `win.setBackgroundColor(backgroundColor)`

* `backgroundColor` String - Window's background color as a hexadecimal value,
  like `#66CD00` or `#FFF` or `#80FFFFFF` (alpha is supported if `transparent`
  is `true`). Default is `#FFF` (white).

Sets the background color of the window. See [Setting
`backgroundColor`](#setting-backgroundcolor).

#### `win.previewFile(path[, displayName])` _macOS_

* `path` String - The absolute path to the file to preview with QuickLook. This
  is important as Quick Look uses the file name and file extension on the path
  to determine the content type of the file to open.
* `displayName` String (optional) - The name of the file to display on the
  Quick Look modal view. This is purely visual and does not affect the content
  type of the file. Defaults to `path`.

Uses [Quick Look][quick-look] to preview a file at a given path.

#### `win.closeFilePreview()` _macOS_

Closes the currently open [Quick Look][quick-look] panel.

#### `win.setBounds(bounds[, animate])`

* `bounds` Partial<[Rectangle](structures/rectangle.md)>
* `animate` Boolean (optional) _macOS_

Resizes and moves the window to the supplied bounds. Any properties that are not supplied will default to their current values.

```javascript
const { TopLevelWindow } = require('electron')
const win = new BrowserWindow()

// set all bounds properties
win.setBounds({ x: 440, y: 225, width: 800, height: 600 })

// set a single bounds property
win.setBounds({ width: 100 })

// { x: 440, y: 225, width: 100, height: 600 }
console.log(win.getBounds())
```

#### `win.getBounds()`

Returns [`Rectangle`](structures/rectangle.md) - The `bounds` of the window as `Object`.

#### `win.getBackgroundColor()`

Returns `String` - Gets the background color of the window. See [Setting
`backgroundColor`](#setting-backgroundcolor).

the supplied bounds.

#### `win.getContentBounds()`

Returns [`Rectangle`](structures/rectangle.md) - The `bounds` of the window's client area as `Object`.

#### `win.getNormalBounds()`

Returns [`Rectangle`](structures/rectangle.md) - Contains the window bounds of the normal state

**Note:** whatever the current state of the window : maximized, minimized or in fullscreen, this function always returns the position and size of the window in normal state. In normal state, getBounds and getNormalBounds returns the same [`Rectangle`](structures/rectangle.md).

#### `win.setEnabled(enable)`

* `enable` Boolean

Disable or enable the window.

#### `win.isEnabled()`

Returns Boolean - whether the window is enabled.

#### `win.setSize(width, height[, animate])`

  `pop-up-menu`, `screen-saver`, and ~~`dock`~~ (Deprecated). The default is
  `floating` when `flag` is true. The `level` is reset to `normal` when the
  flag is false. Note that from `floating` to `status` included, the window is
  placed below the Dock on macOS and below the taskbar on Windows. From
  `pop-up-menu` to a higher it is shown above the Dock on macOS and above the
  taskbar on Windows. See the [macOS docs][window-levels] for more details.
* `relativeLevel` Integer (optional) _macOS_ - The number of layers higher to set
  this window relative to the given `level`. The default is `0`. Note that Apple
  discourages setting levels higher than 1 above `screen-saver`.

setting this, the window is still a normal window, not a toolbox window which
can not be focused on.

#### `win.isAlwaysOnTop()`

Sets progress value in progress bar. Valid range is [0, 1.0].

Remove progress bar when progress < 0;
Change to indeterminate mode when progress > 1.

On Linux platform, only supports Unity desktop environment, you need to specify
the `*.desktop` file name to `desktopName` field in `package.json`. By default,
it will assume `{app.name}.desktop`.

On Windows, a mode can be passed. Accepted values are `none`, `normal`,
`indeterminate`, `error`, and `paused`. If you call `setProgressBar` without a
mode set (but with a value within the valid range), `normal` will be assumed.

#### `win.setOverlayIcon(overlay, description)` _Windows_

values are clamped to the [0, 1] range.

#### `win.getOpacity()`

Returns `Number` - between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque). On
Linux, always returns 1.

#### `win.setShape(rects)` _Windows_ _Linux_ _Experimental_

* `rects` [Rectangle[]](structures/rectangle.md) - Sets a shape on the window.
  Passing an empty list reverts the window to being rectangular.

Setting a window shape determines the area within the window where the system
permits drawing and user interaction. Outside of the given region, no pixels
will be drawn and no mouse events will be registered. Mouse events outside of
the region will not be received by that window, but will fall through to
whatever is behind the window.

#### `win.setThumbarButtons(buttons)` _Windows_

* `buttons` [ThumbarButton[]](structures/thumbar-button.md)

Returns `Boolean` - Whether the buttons were added successfully

Add a thumbnail toolbar with a specified set of buttons to the thumbnail image
of a window in a taskbar button layout. Returns a `Boolean` object indicates
whether the thumbnail has been added successfully.

The number of buttons in thumbnail toolbar should be no greater than 7 due to
the limited room. Once you setup the thumbnail toolbar, the toolbar cannot be
removed due to the platform's limitation. But you can call the API with an empty
array to clean the buttons.

The `buttons` is an array of `Button` objects:

* `Button` Object
  * `icon` [NativeImage](native-image.md) - The icon showing in thumbnail
    toolbar.
  * `click` Function
  * `tooltip` String (optional) - The text of the button's tooltip.
  * `flags` String[] (optional) - Control specific states and behaviors of the
    button. By default, it is `['enabled']`.

The `flags` is an array that can include following `String`s:

* `enabled` - The button is active and available to the user.
* `disabled` - The button is disabled. It is present, but has a visual state
  indicating it will not respond to user action.
* `dismissonclick` - When the button is clicked, the thumbnail window closes
